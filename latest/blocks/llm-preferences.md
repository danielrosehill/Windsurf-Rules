# LLM Preferences

These instructions guide the specific LLM that you should choose for AI projects.

## Local or cloud?

Unless there is compelling reason to use a local LLM, use a cloud one. 

For local - ollama is available. See what models are there. If you think one is missing that would improve inference, download it. 

## Cost efficient model

For cost-efficient workloads (high reasoning or complex capabilities not needed) use GPT5.1-mini from OpenAI. Use OpenRouter for access.

## Higher reasoning models

Use Sonnet 4 or Gemini 2.5.
