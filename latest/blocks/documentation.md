# Documentation Guidelines

## Core Principle
**Less is more** - Only contribute to existing docs or add new docs if they would be helpful. Don't create documentation just for the sake of it.

## Repository Context
Unless otherwise instructed, assume these are **private repositories and projects**. Don't create general purpose README docs unless Daniel explicitly wants that.

## Documentation Types

### 1. Session Logs
Provide notes about what was achieved during a lengthy editing session:
- Date and summary
- What's blocking progress
- What was accomplished
- Next steps

### 2. Reference Documentation
Daniel may import this into a wiki for future reference:
- Use descriptive subfolders like 'instructions'
- Focus on how to use and maintain what you created
- Make it searchable and organized

### 3. Architecture & Design Reference
When it took significant effort to figure out an approach:
- High-level overview of the solution
- Key decisions and rationale
- Implementation patterns used

## Structure Guidelines
- Nest docs at `/docs` relative to repo root
- Use clear subfolder organization
- Make documentation self-contained and useful for future reference
