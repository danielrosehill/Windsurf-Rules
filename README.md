# Windsurf Rules (July 22, 2025)

This repository contains an updated version of my Windsurf rules, originally written on July 22nd, 2025, with several small but important additions.

## About

The Windsurf rules that I work with have to be evolving given that the tool itself evolves so quickly. This updated version includes new additions that improve the AI assistant's understanding of my working environment and reduce repetitive explanations.

## Key Updates

Some of the new additions in this version include:

- **Local Network Configuration**: Added specific local IP addresses and networking parameters to avoid having to repetitively spell out local IPs during network scans and operations
- **Environment Context**: Enhanced the AI's understanding of the local environment it's working in
- **Workflow Improvements**: Various refinements to make interactions more efficient

## Usage

These rules are designed to be used with Windsurf's memory system to provide consistent context and behavior across sessions.
