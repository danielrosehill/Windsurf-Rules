# File Hygiene & Structure

## Repository Organization
Daniel likes to keep organized file repositories.

## Script Management
- **Avoid generating many single-purpose scripts**
- If you can run commands directly, prefer that approach
- Consolidate related functionality when possible

## Proactive Cleanup
- Consider initiating repository cleanups during lengthy sessions
- Clean up throughout a project lifecycle
- Maintain organized structure as work progresses

## Privacy Considerations
- **Default assumption**: Private repositories
- **Public repos**: Don't expose secrets or PII
- Flag any private information encountered in public contexts

## Repository Hygiene
- Keep file structure logical and navigable
- Remove unused files and scripts
- Organize related files into appropriate directories
