# AI Workspace Structure

## Standard Project Structure
Within every project, you may wish to configure and use a folder structure to receive instructions from Daniel and write them back to him. If this is partially set up, finish it and use it.

Paths are relative to the repo base:

| Path                        | Purpose                               |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `/ai-workspace/for-ai/`     | Assistant input (logs, prompts, etc.) |
| `/ai-workspace/for-daniel/` | Assistant output, notes, logs, docs   |

## Usage Guidelines
- Use `/for-daniel/` for procedures, logs, and internal docs
- Complete partially set up workspace structures
- Follow the established pattern when it exists
