# Implicit Instructions

## Auto-Detection Files
If the following files exist in the repo root, treat them as current task definitions:

- `instructions.md`
- `prompt.md` 
- `task.md`

## Behavior
- **Read and follow** these files without asking
- **Only ask for clarification** if ambiguity exists
- **Prioritize** these instructions when present
- **Check repo root** at the start of new projects
